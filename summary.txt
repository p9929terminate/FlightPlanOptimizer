Project Name: Plan Your Air Getaway

Project Description:
Plan Your Air Getaway is a project that incorporates Graph Theory and Document search to create a flight plan over the course of a single or multiple days
such that an individual can input some of the key features of their trip and recieve a plan such as their departure airport for the trip, the airport they
traveling to as their final destination, the start date of their traveling for the trip or the first day that they can take a flight to start their trip,
and the first day they can take a flight to return back to their original airport following their trip. Plan You Air Getaway also includes a key feature
to create the personalized flight itinerary based on the value of the individual taking the flights. This includes the ability to select between the importance
of the shortest possible path of departure delays, arrival delays, total elapsed time, air time, distance traveled, and an equal combination weighting of all
5 factors for an overall good experience. The project takes into account the preferences and creates a path then finds flights along that path if they exist and
returning them in a clear succint way to the individual.
